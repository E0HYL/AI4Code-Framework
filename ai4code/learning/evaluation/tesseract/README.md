# tesseract-ml

As malware evolves over time, the performance of malware detectors tends to degrade. Many solutions in the security literature fail to consider the time information associated with the samples while evaluating their classifier which can induce positive bias in the results. 

This repository contains the source code for a prototype implementation of Tesseract.  

Further details can be found in the paper *TESSERACT: Eliminating Experimental Bias in Malware Classification across Space and Time*. F.  Pendlebury, F. Pierazzi, R. Jordaney, J. Kinder, and L. Cavallaro.  USENIX Sec 2019. Check also `https://s2lab.kcl.ac.uk/projects/tesseract` for up-to-date information on the project, e.g., a talk at USENIX Enigma 2019 at `https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2019/presentation/cavallaro`.

## Getting Started 

### Installation

Tesseract requires Python 3 (preferably >= 3.5) as well as the statistical learning stack of NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn. 

Package dependencies can be installed by using the listing in `requirements.txt`. 

```shell 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A full installation can be peformed using `setup.py`: 

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install 
```

### Usage 

Basic usage, dividing a dataset into time-aware sets and performing a time-aware evaluation. 
More complex examples can be found in the `examples/` and `test/` directories. 

```python
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from tesseract import evaluation, temporal, metrics, mock


def main():
    # Generate dummy predictors, labels and timestamps from Gaussians
    X, y, t = mock.generate_binary_test_data(10000, '2014', '2016')

    # Partition dataset
    splits = temporal.time_aware_train_test_split(
        X, y, t, train_size=12, test_size=1, granularity='month')

    # Perform a timeline evaluation
    clf = LinearSVC()
    results = evaluation.fit_predict_update(clf, *splits)
    
    # View results 
    metrics.print_metrics(results)
    
    # View AUT(F1, 24 months) as a measure of robustness over time 
    print(metrics.aut(results, 'f1'))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

## Running the tests 

To run all unittests within the `test/` directory: 

```shell 
python -m unittest 
```

## Current Working State 

Tesseract is still a research prototype and subject to breaking changes, although following a recent redesign we 
expect such changes to be kept to a minimum. Due to this redesign there may also be discrepancies between the current 
implementation and §6 of the Tesseract manuscript---although we are aiming to soon publish a short technical report
that details the new design. We know this can be frustrating and thank you for your patience!

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please feel free to contact the maintainer directly 
at `feargus.pendlebury [at] kcl.ac.uk` and cc `lorenzo.cavallaro [at] kcl.ac.uk`.
